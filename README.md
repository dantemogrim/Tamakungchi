## About

This project is based off of a school assignment called 'The Useless Web' - a reference to an actual [website](https://theuselessweb.com/). The instructions were in short to create a pointless site, in order to get acquainted with some of the basic syntax of JavaScript. <br>
I decided to go with a nostalgic approach. Hope you like it! <br>
The requirements included the following: <br>

> - The project should use at least three types of event listeners for example scroll, click and keypress.
> - The project should use some kind of iteration for example map, forEach or for.
> - The project should use arrays or objects or both to store values.
> - The project should have a nice user interface with consistent margins and paddings.
> - The project should use CSS variables for colors and font families..
> - The project should use at least one self hosted font with woff and woff2 format.
> - The project should be responsive and be built using the method mobile-first.
> - The project should use responsive images when using images.
> - The project should implement an accessible graphical user interface.
> - The project must not include any coding errors, warning or notices.
> - The project must be tested on at least two of your classmates computers. Add the testers name to the README.md file.
> - The project should be deployed to either Netlify or Vercel
> - The application should be pushed to a public repository on GitHub.
> - The application should be useless üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
